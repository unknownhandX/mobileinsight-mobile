## Contributing

There are many ways in which you can contribute to MobileInsight.
Pull requests are just one thing amongst others that you can submit to help the
project. We also welcome feedback, bug reports, feature requests, documentation
improvements, advertisement & advocating, testing and many different things.
Just talk to us if you want to help, and we will help you help us.

## Feedback

This is by far the easiest way to contribute something. If you are using
MobileInsight for your own project, don't hesitate sharing. If you have something
that you would like to tell us, please don't hesitate. You can reach us either
by [joining](https://goo.gl/htJGqT) our [Slack Dev Channel](https://mobileinsight-dev.slack.com) or email
us at support@mobileinsight.net.


We are also interested in the problems you had when getting started. Please
feel encouraged to report any obstacles you encountered such as missing
documentation, misleading directions or similar.
We are perfectionists, so even if it's just a typo, let us know.

## Reporting an Issue

If you have any problems, a crash, a segfault, missing documentation, invalid
spelling, weird examples, please take 2 minutes to report the issue by opening
a new issue on our repo as you would to other projects. Please just follow the
templates so that we can understand your issue as fast as possible.

## Code Contributions

Code contributions (patches, new features) are the most obvious way to help with
the project's development. Since this is quite common, we ask you to follow our
workflow to most efficiently work with us. Adhering to our workflow ensures that
your contribution won't be forgotten or lost. Also, your name will always be
associated with the change you made, which basically means eternal fame in our
code history (you can opt-out if you don't want that).


* Coding style: please follow the [PEP8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) coding style in Python since the majority of the MobileInsight codes are written in Python.
* Performance: read [Python performance tips](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSpeed/PerformanceTips)
* [Code Workflow](https://kivy.org/docs/contribute.html#code-workflow): we learn and build the project from good examples, so please follow them as they have proven to be very successful.

## Documentation Contributions

Documentation contributions generally follow the same workflow as code
contributions, just a bit more lax. We don't ask you to go through all the
hassle just to correct a single typo. For more complex contributions, please
follow the suggested workflow.


__Acknowledgment__: This contributing guide is mainly based on [Kivy](https://github.com/kivy/kivy)'s [contributing guide](https://github.com/kivy/kivy/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
